song 1: intruder (by riya)
-[ez1,nm3,hd4,ex7,he9
An unfamiliar shadow slips into my mind. The feeling of being watched, a presence that doesn't belong. My thoughts scatter, senses on high alert. Something's here, creeping at the edges of perception. It's an invasion, but from where? Or what?

song 2: Primatrix (by silentroom)
-[ez2,nm4,hd6,ex8,he9
The air is heavy, each breath thick with tension. A strange stillness, charged with potential. Movement feels deliberate, like wading through a dense fog. Every step is uncertain, every sound amplified. Silence isn't empty; it pulses, thrumming with unseen force. My heartbeat syncs with the quiet, amplifying the anticipation.

song 3: shuffle heaven (by RYO)
-[ez6,nm7,hd8,ex10,he10]
Disorder reigns. The world spins and shifts, shapes blur and re-form. Patterns that defy logic, a chaotic dance of elements. Everything is in flux, a whirlwind of impressions that leave me dizzy. An uncanny beauty hides within the chaos, a fleeting glimpse of order that vanishes as quickly as it appears. The ground beneath me feels unstable, like I'm walking on shifting sands.

song 4: everytime we touch [fvrwrd's 700bom speedcore edit) (by Fvrwvrd)
A spark, a jolt of connection, too sudden and intense to process. The sensation floods my senses, overwhelming and electric. No room for thought, only pure, raw experience. My pulse races, trying to keep pace with the unrelenting surge. The world around me becomes a blur, a rapid succession of lights and sounds. My body struggles to match the intensity, a dance on the edge of control.

boss: oxygen destroyer (by KARUT)
-[ez6,nm7,hd8,ex10,je10]
Pressure builds, a weight around my chest that tightens with each breath. The air grows thin, each inhale a desperate grasp for relief. My lungs burn, vision narrows. The force is unyielding, pushing me to the brink. My surroundings darken, the edges fray, and reality starts to unravel. Each heartbeat is a struggle, each moment a battle against the suffocating force.

Song 1: Phi (by Street)
ez:5,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:10
Symbols dance in the dark, geometric forms that twist and turn. Each shape pulls at my mind, a puzzle with no solution. They shift, almost organic, alive. A deeper understanding feels just out of reach, a complexity that mocks my comprehension. Patterns emerge, intricate and unknowable, a secret language whispering in the silence.

Song 2: Nyarlathotep's Dreamland (by Raimukun)
ez:5,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:10
A landscape of dreams, but whose dreams? Visions flicker, half-formed and fleeting. Figures from the edges of sanity, an alien architecture that defies logic. Shadows move with purpose, entities woven from nightmares. The boundaries between real and unreal blur, my mind struggles to separate the two. A presence, familiar yet foreign, watching from the periphery.

Song 3: I (by chroma)
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:10
A reflection, but not quite. The mirror image of my soul, distorted and raw. It’s me, but different, stripped of pretenses. I confront myself, layers peeled away to reveal the core. Emotions surge, unfiltered and intense, a raw honesty that’s both liberating and terrifying. I face the essence of my being, unadorned and exposed.

Song 4: northern_limit [feat. Sennzai] (by kobaryo)
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:10
A boundary, far to the north, a limit to what I know. Beyond lies the unknown, a frontier shrouded in mystery. The air is colder, the light dimmer. Voices whisper of ancient things, truths hidden beneath the ice. The edge of the world, a line I’m hesitant to cross. Yet the pull is irresistible, a call to venture into the depths of the unseen.

boss: xeroa (by camellia)
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:10
An overwhelming force, an entity of pure power. It stands before me, a monolith of energy and intent. The air crackles with its presence, an electric anticipation. My heart races, fear and awe intertwined. I’m drawn to it, despite the danger, a moth to a flame. It’s a confrontation inevitable, a clash with something far beyond my understanding.

song 1: #1f1e33 (by camellia)
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:10
Darkness, an expanse painted in shades unknown. My vision narrows, adjusting to the void. Whispers in the shadows, secrets wrapped in layers of night. There'’s a pulse, a steady rhythm beneath the silence. Clors that shouldn’t exist, hues that defy description. Each moment stretches, an eternity in a heartbeat. I reach out, but the darkness swallows my grasp.

song 2: 25N168W [depths of the abyss] (by Iboibo)
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:10
Depths unimaginable. Pressure crushes, an abyss that pulls me deeper. Cold, unyielding, a vast emptiness. Coordinates blur, a map with no bearing. My senses scream, overwhelmed by the weight of the unseen. Light flickers, distant and unattainable. The abyss holds its secrets tight, each one a whisper from the deep.

song 3: this train is going nowhere [final destination (egts ver.)] (by Coltrane)
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:10
Tracks stretch endlessly, a journey with no destination. Metal screeches, the sound of despair. Windows reveal nothing, just the blur of motion. Every stop feels the same, an illusion of progress. Faces pass, empty and void of recognition. The train moves, but I’m stationary, trapped in a cycle. The final destination looms, yet remains just out of reach.

song 4: 5D TETRIS MATCH&REMATCH (cut ver.) [T-Spin Quadruple]
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:10,he:11
Shapes twist and turn, a dance of geometry. Pieces fall, interlock, break apart. Space warps, dimensions fold into themselves. A game, but the rules are fluid, ever-changing. Each move calculated, a strategy in chaos. I lose myself in the patterns, a maze of logic and madness. Winning and losing blur, just the act of playing remains.

boss: we want to run (by frums)
ez:7,nm:8,hd:9,ex:11,he:12
We run, an instinctual urge. Something chases, unseen but felt. Breath comes in gasps, the world blurs around me. Feet pound the ground, a rhythm of desperation. Paths twist, obstacles emerge. We can’t stop, won’t stop. The need to escape, overpowering. The goal is distant, but we strive, driven by a primal urge to survive.



-=-chapter 4-=-
necrophagiatoast (by kobaryo)
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:11,he:11
The void swallows me whole, a hunger that knows no bounds. Shapes twist and distort, an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of nightmares. I reach out, but the darkness coils around my fingers, mocking my attempts. Shadows dance, whispers echo, and I am lost in a labyrinth of my own making. The silence is suffocating, a weight on my chest that threatens to crush me.

song 2: O (by seatrus)
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:11,he:11
A world of echoes, voices that call from the depths. They speak of things I cannot understand, truths buried beneath layers of forgotten memory. Colors bleed together, a canvas painted with madness. Time bends, stretches, folds upon itself. I grasp for meaning, but the threads slip through my fingers like sand.

song 3: apollo (
ez:6,nm:7,hd:8,ex:11,he:11
A beacon in the darkness. Its light is blinding, yet comforting. A journey through the cosmos, a pilgrimage to the heart of the unknown. Stars pulse with life, distant and unreachable. I am but a speck in the vastness, a witness to the grandeur of creation. The universe unfolds before me, a tapestry woven with stardust and dreams.

song 4: aragami
ez76,nm:8,hd:9,ex:11,he:12
A force of nature unleashed. Its presence is overwhelming, a storm on the horizon. Blades clash, shadows dance, and I am caught in the midst of a battle that transcends time itself. Power surges through me, a primal force that threatens to consume. I fight, not for victory, but for survival. Each strike is a testament to my will, a defiance against the inevitable.

boss: world ender
ez:8,nm:9,hd:10,ex:12,he:13
Presence shakes the very foundation of existence. I stand before it, a mortal facing a god. The air crackles with energy, reality bends to its will. Fear grips me, but I stand firm, ready to face my fate. The world trembles, a symphony of chaos and despair. I am but a player in its grand design, a witness to the end of all things.


chapter 5
song 1: destination 2f29
ez:8,nm:9,hd:10,ex:12,he:13
Digits flicker, a destination lost in the static. 2f29? The path twists, turns, vanishes. Each step, a descent into the unknown. Clarity dissolves, the air hums with uncertainty. Am I moving forward, or am I lost?

song 2: aleph-0
ez:9,nm:10,hd:11,ex:12,he:13
An endless expanse, infinity in a symbol. Boundless, yet contained. A concept that stretches the mind, bends reality. I try to grasp it, but it slips through my thoughts, a horizon without end. Everything feels vast, endless. I’m adrift, without anchor or aim.

song 3: marenol
ez:9,nm:10,hd:11,ex:12,he:13
Echoes of a melody, haunting, elusive. It tugs at memories, half-formed and distant. The air feels thick, laden with a scent I can’t place. It’s familiar, yet alien, a ghost of a past I can’t recall. Each breath is a journey through a fog of forgotten moments. Faces blur, places shift, everything is mutable.

song 4: solips
ez:10,nm:10,hd:11,ex:13,he:14
Reality warps and bends under unseen forces, a solipsistic nightmare where I question the very nature of existence. Am I the only one here, lost in a reflection of my own mind? The edges of reality fray and unravel, leaving nothing but a void where once there was substance. I spiral inward, trapped in a loop of uncertainty with no discernible end.

boss: tsunagite
ez:11,nm:11,hd:11,ex:13,he:15
As I emerge from the depths of my own psyche, I find myself in a new reality. But it's not quite right. I am here, yet not here. It's as if I'm linked to this world by a thread, a connection that transcends the boundaries of space and time. I struggle to make sense of it all, to find my place in this strange new reality that defies all logic.
